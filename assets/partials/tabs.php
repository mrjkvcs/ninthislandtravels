            included in the amount of your Request. In addition, we charge a separate and additional processing fee,
            which is included in the "Government Taxes, Airline Fees and Agent Fees" amount disclosed to you. The fee

            summary of key terms of an airlineâ€™s baggage fees, but each airline should be consulted for complete
            information about its baggage and other ancillary fees.

            <h3>3 Hotel Service Restrictions</h3>
            <p>
            General
            a. Check In: Upon check-in, the reservation holder must present a valid ID and credit card or, in the
            hotel's discretion, debit card, in his or her name (the amount of available credit required will vary by
            hotel). Debit cards may not be accepted.
            b. Double Occupancy: All hotel reservations are guaranteed for double occupancy (i.e. 2 adults) and
            accommodations for more than two adults are not guaranteed. Some hotels may not allow extra guests. If your
            hotel does allow extra guests, there may be additional charges. These charges vary and will be payable
            directly to the hotel.
            c. Late Arrival and Failure to Check-in on First Night: While you should call Ninth Island Travels if you
            wish to cancel a cancellable reservation in advance of your stay, if you are going to be delayed on your
            date of check in or find that you cannot check in to your hotel on the date you requested, you should
            contact the hotel to let them know. If you fail to check in to your hotel on the day of your reservation and
            do not alert the hotel, the remaining portion of your reservation may be canceled and you may not be
            entitled to a refund, depending on the terms and conditions of the applicable hotel.
            d. Cancellations and Changes to Your Reservation: Hotel cancellation policies vary. Certain reservations are
            non-cancellable and non-changeable. Others require you to pay a penalty if you cancel. If changes to your
            pre-paid reservation are allowed, any changes to a pre-paid reservation are only permitted as a cancellation
            and booking of a new reservation.
            h. Disability Needs: If you have disability needs (for example only, you need a wheelchair accessible room
            or require the use of a service animal) you must call the hotel and verify that disability needs can be met.
            If your disability needs cannot be accommodated by the hotel, please call Ninth Island Travels customer
            service.
            j. Hotel Accommodations and Special Requests: You may or may not be able to select your room type and number
            and type of beds. Room assignments are based on hotel availability and are at the hotel's discretion. We
            cannot guarantee a non-smoking room. If you have special requests (including, for example, preferences for
            smoking or nonsmoking rooms, a specific room, particular bedding, floor location, closeness to an elevator,
            connecting rooms, or pet accommodations), you must call the hotel and verify that special requests can be
            met after you have made your booking. Since Ninth Island Travels has no control over which room a hotel will
            assign to you, Ninth Island Travels cannot accommodate special requests in advance of your booking and
            cannot guarantee that special requests will be met.
            k. Must be 21 Years of Age: The guest on the reservation must be 21 years or older to check into the hotel.
            l. Frequent Traveler Points: Frequent traveler points, upgrades, certificate vouchers and other discounts or
            incentives may not apply to hotel services.
            m. Hotel Star Ratings (General): Ninth Island Travels screens participating hotels carefully and updates our
            information periodically to ensure the validity of our ratings. Our ratings systems may sometimes differ
            from those of other rating systems that you may be familiar with. We do not warrant or guarantee that our
            star rating system is equal to or consistent with any other star rating system and reserve the right to
            change a hotel's rating at any time with or without notice.
            n. Accommodation Types: Ninth Island Travels offers its customers various properties, including hotels,
            motels, bed and breakfasts, resorts and other types of rentable accommodations.
            o. Prices: Please check the room and rate details thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your
            reservation.
            p. Pricing Errors: We endeavor to publish and maintain accurate prices and information for the services we
            offer, including but not limited to our services. Hotels provide us with the price and other information
            related to these services. In the event, however, that a service is listed or provided to us at an incorrect
            price or with incorrect information due to typographical error or other error in pricing or service
            information received from a hotel, we retain the right to refuse or cancel any Requests placed for such
            service. We shall have the right to refuse or cancel any such Requests whether or not the order has been
            confirmed and/or your credit card charged. If your credit card has already been charged for the purchase and
            your Request is canceled because of incorrect hotel information, we will promptly issue a credit to your
            credit card account in the amount of the charge. Prices, rates and inventory are subject to availability
            from the hotel.

            <h3>4 Merchant Price Disclosed Hotel Service :</h3>
            <p>
            Ninth Island Travels Merchant Price Disclosed Hotel Service is a hotel service whereby the price of the
            hotel is disclosed to the User in advance of booking and whereby Ninth Island Travels acts as the merchant
            of record on the transaction (i.e., directly charges your credit or debit card or other form of payment and
            not the hotel).
            Hotel bookings made available through Ninth Island Travels Merchant Price Disclosed Hotel Service are
            subject to the disclosed terms and conditions on your contract page and the disclosed terms and conditions
            of the applicable hotel you select.
            Charges for Taxes and Service Fees:
            Charges for Taxes and Fees: In connection with facilitating a Merchant Price Disclosed Hotel transaction, we
            will charge your method of payment for Taxes and Fees. This charge includes an anticipated amount to recover
            the amount we pay to the hotel in connection with your reservation for taxes owed by the hotel including,
            without limitation, sales and use tax, occupancy tax, room tax, excise tax, value added tax and/or other
            similar taxes. In certain locations, the tax amount may also include government imposed service fees or
            other fees not paid directly to the taxing authorities but required by law to be collected by the hotel. The
            amount paid to the hotel in connection with your reservation for taxes may vary from the amount we
            anticipate and include in the charge to you. The balance of the charge for Taxes and Fees is a fee we retain
            as part of the compensation for our services and to cover the costs of your reservation, including, for
            example, customer service costs. The charge for Taxes and Fees varies based on a number of factors
            including, without limitation, the amount we pay the hotel and the location of the hotel where you will be
            staying, and may include profit that we retain.
            Except as described below, we are not the vendor collecting and remitting taxes to the applicable taxing
            authorities. Our hotel suppliers, as vendors, bill all applicable taxes to us and we pay over such amounts
            directly to the vendors. We are not a co-vendor associated with the vendor with whom we book or reserve our
            customer's travel arrangements. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate and the type of applicable taxes
            vary greatly by location.
            For transactions involving Merchant Price Disclosed Hotels located within certain jurisdictions, the charge
            to your debit or credit card for Taxes and Fees includes an additional payment of tax that we are required
            to collect and remit to the jurisdiction for tax owed on amounts we retain as compensation for our services.
            Depending on the Merchant Price Disclosed property you stay at you may also be charged (i) certain mandatory
            hotel specific service fees, for example, resort fees (which typically apply to resort type destinations
            and, if applicable, may range from $10 to $40 per day), energy surcharges, newspaper delivery fees, in-room
            safe fees, tourism fees, or housekeeping fees and/or (ii) certain optional incidental fees, for example,
            parking charges, minibar charges, phone calls, room service and movie rentals, etc.. These charges, if
            applicable, will be payable by you to the hotel directly at checkout. When you check in, a credit card or,
            in the hotel's discretion, a debit card, will be required to secure these charges and fees that you may
            incur during your stay. Please contact the hotel directly as to whether and which charges or service fees
            apply.
            </p>

            We or the applicable hotel may, on an exception basis and at the request of the hotel guest, waive one or
            more of the restrictions after the hotel room has been booked. We may, in our discretion, impose additional

            the compensation for our services and to cover the costs of your reservation, including, for example,
            customer service costs. The charge for Taxes and Fees varies based on a number of factors including, without
            limitation, the amount we pay the hotel and the location of the hotel where you will be staying, and may
            include profit that we retain.
